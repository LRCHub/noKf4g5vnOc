Beauty is in the eye
Beauty is in the eye
Thank you for this kiss
It's all I really wanted
If you believe that darling
Then you'd better run
Thank you for this kiss
Thank you for this kiss
So beauty is in the eye
Of the beholder
If you believe that
Darling I'm looking at you
If you believe that
Darling I'm looking at you
Go on believing that
But darling you'd better run
You'll never be a cover girl
Just facing facts
Your face isn't right
But I'll never want another girl
Now I've seen you in this light
Thank you for this kiss
Thank you for this kiss
Thank you for this kiss
It's all I really wanted
If you believe that darling
You'd better run
If you believe that darling
Then you'd better run, run
'Cause you'll never be a cover girl
Just facing facts
Your face isn't right
But I'll never want
Never want a cover girl
Now I've seen you in this light
Your never be a cover girl
Just facing facts
Your face isn't right
But I'll never want, never need
A cover girl
Now I've seen you in this light
I'll never be, never be a gentleman
Just facing facts
My face isn't right
And you'll never want, never want
A gentleman
Now you've seen me in that light
I'll never be a gentleman
Just facing facts
My face isn't right
You'll never want a gentleman
When you see me in this light
