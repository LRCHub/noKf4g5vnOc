I'm not afraid
I can count on you
To catch me now
I'll just let go
One thing is true
You won't let me down
With your arms around to

Cover me
With the sweetest touch
I've ever known
Cover me
You won't let me
Face love alone

I know that smile
It's like a shelter over me
Your arms will reach me
Wherever my heart leads
I'll blindly believe you'll

Cover me
With the sweetest touch
I've ever known
Cover me
You won't let me
Face love alone

Cover me
I lay beneath the sky above
I close my eyes and let your love
Cover me

Cover me
With the sweetest touch
I've ever known
Cover me
You won't let me
Face love alone

Cover me
With the sweetest touch
I've ever known
Cover me
You won't let me
Face love alone

Cover me
Cover me
With the sweetest touch
I've ever known
Cover me
You won't let me
Face love alone
