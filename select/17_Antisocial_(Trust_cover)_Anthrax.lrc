[00:39.32] You're a train ride to no importance
[00:41.75] You're in love with hell existence
[00:44.05] The money is all that you desire
[00:46.28] Why don't you pack it in and retire
[00:48.57] It's common nature you can't fool me
[00:50.86] I'm just the money that you can't let free

[01:44.72] 
[01:28.98] You put a price tag on what you see
[01:31.13] This one's for you, that's for me
[01:33.58] If that's winning I'd rather lose
[01:35.85] Why don't you listen to my senseless views
[01:56.85] 
[01:40.53] You're anti, you're antisocial
[01:45.17] You're anti, you're antisocial
